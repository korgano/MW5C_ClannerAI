# MW5C_ClannerAI
Open source project for improving MechWarrior 5: Clans ally AI

## Goals of this project
It's my hope that by open sourcing these project files, the MW5C mod community can quickly and effectively improve the state of ally AI in-game.

These files provide the following base for development and testing:

- Improved aim curve for ally units
- Improved target weights for ally units
- Somewhat improved AI behavior trees

## Collaboration

The Discussions section has been enabled to allow MW5C modders to interact and collaborate in a publicly visible and accessible method.

The Wiki section will contain various bits of information for modder reference.

## Requirements:

- Epic Games Store
